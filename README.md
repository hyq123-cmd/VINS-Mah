# VINS-Mah
## A monocular visual-inertial odometry algorithm for dynamic environments
VINS-Mah achieves better performance in dynamic environments than the baseline methods while doesn't degrade in static scenarios. It is building on the well-known method [VINS-Fusion](git@github.com:HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion.git). However, our proposed method only supports one configuration which is "one camera and one IMU". More configurations might be developed in the future.
## Running environments
We recommend to refer the VINS-Fusion project, since there is no any extra packages for running this algorithm. The only thing you might pay an attention is that we are running and testing our method on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic.
