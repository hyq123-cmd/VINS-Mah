# VINS-Mah
## A monocular visual-inertial odometry for dynamic environments
VINS-Mah achieves better performance in dynamic environments than the baseline methods while not degrading in static scenarios. It is built on the well-known method [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion.git). However, our proposed method only supports one configuration, which is "one camera and one IMU". More configurations might be developed in the future.

## Running environments
We recommend referring the VINS-Fusion project, as there are no additional packages required to  run this algorithm. The only thing you might want to pay attention to is that we ran and tested this method on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic.The required configuration environment is OpenCV 4.2.0 and Ceres Solver 1.14.0.

## Prerequisites
### 1.1 Ubuntu and ROS
Ubuntu 20.04.[Ubuntu Installation](https://www.releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)

ROS Noetic: [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

### 1.2 Ceres Sovler
The 1.14.0 version is used in this project, we recommend installing it using following command:
```
sudo apt-get install libceres-dev
```
### 1.3 OpenCV
OpenCV 4.2.0,If you are using the Noetic version of ROS, it comes with OpenCV 4.2.0 pre - installed.

## Build VINS-Mah
Clone the repository and catkin build:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hyq123-cmd/VINS-Mah.git
cd ../
catkin build vins_mah
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
## VIODE Example
You can download the [VIODE dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4493401) to your dataset folder Dataset_Folder.  The following will run 0_none.bag under city_day in the form of monocular camera + IMU.
```
roslaunch vins_mah vins_viode.launch
rosbag play Dataset_Folder/city_day/0_none.bag
```
