# VINS-Mah
## A monocular visual-inertial odometry for dynamic environments
VINS-Mah achieves better performance in dynamic environments than the baseline methods while not degrading in static scenarios. It is built on the well-known method [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion.git). However, our proposed method only supports one configuration, which is "one camera and one IMU". More configurations might be developed in the future.
## Running environments
We recommend referring the VINS-Fusion project, as there are no additional packages required to  run this algorithm. The only thing you might want to pay attention to is that we ran and tested this method on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic.
